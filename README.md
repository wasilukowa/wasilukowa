#### I want to become front end developer who solves more problems than creates :)

### I am currently working on new projects that will showcase my skills, but they will take some more time to complete. However, you can take a look at my current progress and the code I’ve written so far here. 
This is the most recent work I've done, reflecting what I’ve learned and continue to work on at Academia Localhost.

### Two projects that I created long time ago can be found here:

#### Nawykownik 
Simple Habbit Tracker app which can be used to work on consistently introducing and tracking good habits into life. 
Used technologies: React, React Router and Styled Components. Website is fully responsive. 
There are few new ideas which I will work on to implement but basic functionality is on :)
