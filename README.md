#### I am still learning but I hope to become front end developer who solves more problems than creates :)


### Two projects that I was lately working on can be found here:

#### Nawykownik 
it is simple Habbit Tracker which can be used to work on consistently introducing good habits into life. 
There are few new ideas which I will work on to implement but basic functionality is on :)

- [Nawykownik demo](https://wasilukowa.github.io/nawykownik/#/)

#### Verti website template
Project was build bases on existing Verti by HTML5 template but with React, React Router and Styled Components. RWD!
