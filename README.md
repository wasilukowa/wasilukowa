### Two projects that I was lately working on can be found here:

#### Nawykownik 
Simple Habbit Tracker app which can be used to work on consistently introducing and tracking good habits into life. 
Used technologies: React, React Router and Styled Components. Website is fully responsive. 
There are few new ideas which I will work on to implement but basic functionality is on :)
